# SuiFund: Decentralized Scientific Research Funding Platform

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how scientific research is funded, validated, and monetized using the Sui Move ecosystem.

## Core Concept

Create a decentralized platform where:
1. Researchers can propose studies and experiments
2. Contributors can fund research through tokenized investments
3. Research results and data become tradeable digital assets
4. Peer review is incentivized and tokenized
5. Research impact is tracked and rewarded

## Unique Technical Features

### 1. Dynamic Research Proposals
- Multi-stage funding rounds with automated milestone releases
- Proposal NFTs that evolve as research progresses
- Built-in reproducibility verification system
- Automated fund distribution based on milestone achievement

### 2. Innovative Funding Mechanisms
- Quadratic funding for matching public goods research
- Research-backed tokens that appreciate based on citation metrics
- Option-like instruments for potential research applications
- Cross-chain funding aggregation

### 3. Decentralized Peer Review
- Staking-based peer review system
- Reputation tokens for reviewers
- Automated detection of conflicts of interest
- Zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous yet verifiable reviews

### 4. Research Impact Tracking
- On-chain citation and reference tracking
- Impact factor calculation using oracle networks
- Automated royalty distribution for research derivatives
- Real-time impact metrics using chainlink-style oracles
